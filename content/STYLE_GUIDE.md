# My Marine Forecast — Content Style Guide

## Voice and Tone

- **Knowledgeable but approachable.** Write like an experienced angler explaining something to a friend — not a textbook.
- **Practical and actionable.** Every article should give the reader something they can use on their next trip.
- **Confident without being absolute.** Fishing involves uncertainty. Use phrases like "tends to," "often produces," and "in most conditions" rather than guarantees.
- **Concise.** Respect the reader's time. Get to the point. Cut filler words and unnecessary qualifiers.

## Audience

Coastal anglers and boaters who use weather, tide, and solunar data to plan trips. Range from weekend recreational fishers to experienced inshore/offshore anglers. Assume basic fishing knowledge but explain technical marine and weather concepts.

## Article Structure

1. **Title** — Clear, specific, includes the primary keyword naturally. 60-70 characters ideal for search results.
2. **Introduction** (1-2 paragraphs) — Hook the reader with a relatable scenario or question. State what they'll learn.
3. **Body sections** — Use H2 headings for major sections, H3 for subsections. Each section should cover one concept.
4. **Practical application** — Include a "how to use this" section with numbered steps or actionable advice.
5. **Closing** — Brief summary or call to action pointing to relevant app features.

## Formatting Conventions

- Use **bold** for key terms on first introduction only.
- Use bullet lists for 3+ related items. Use numbered lists for sequential steps.
- Keep paragraphs to 3-4 sentences maximum.
- One idea per paragraph.
- Use H2 (`##`) for main sections, H3 (`###`) for subsections. Do not use H4 or deeper.
- No emojis in article body text.

## SEO Guidelines

- Primary keyword should appear in the title, first paragraph, at least one H2, and the meta description.
- Meta description: 150-160 characters, includes primary keyword, compelling enough to click.
- Use related keywords naturally throughout — do not keyword stuff.
- Article length: 800-1500 words for standard topics, up to 2500 for comprehensive guides.
- Internal links: reference other articles and app features where relevant.

## Topics to Cover

- Tide reading and interpretation
- Solunar theory and feeding periods
- Wind and wave forecasting for boaters
- Barometric pressure and fishing
- Seasonal fishing patterns by region
- Species-specific guides (redfish, snook, tarpon, etc.)
- How to read marine weather forecasts
- Moon phases and fishing

## What to Avoid

- First person ("I") — use "you" to address the reader or third person.
- Clickbait or exaggerated claims.
- Product endorsements or brand mentions (except My Marine Forecast features).
- Overly technical jargon without explanation.
- Content that isn't relevant to marine forecasting, fishing, or boating.
