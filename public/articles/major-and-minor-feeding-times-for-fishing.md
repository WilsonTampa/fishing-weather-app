# Major and Minor Feeding Times for Fishing

*When Fish Are Most Likely to Bite (And Why the Moon Is Behind It)*

Here's a scenario most of us know too well: you fish the same spot two days in a row. Same bait, same technique, same everything. Day one, you can't keep them off the hook. Day two, you'd swear someone drained the fish out of the water overnight. What changed?

The answer might be sitting on a solunar chart you've never looked at. Major and minor feeding periods — predicted windows of peak fish activity based on the moon's position — have been used by serious anglers since the 1920s. Some people swear by them. Others think it's astrology for fishermen. But once you start paying attention, the patterns are hard to ignore.

Let's get into what these feeding windows actually are, where they come from, and how to use them without overthinking it.

## What Are Major and Minor Feeding Periods?

The concept comes from solunar theory, developed by a guy named John Alden Knight back in 1926. Knight spent years studying fishing logs and wildlife activity, and he noticed something: fish and game were consistently more active during specific windows tied to the moon's position relative to where you're standing on Earth.

He broke it down into two types of feeding periods:

**Major Periods** — Two per day, each lasting about 2 hours. These are the prime windows. Fish activity tends to peak during these stretches, and if everything else lines up (tide, weather, you actually being on the water), these can produce the best fishing of the day.

**Minor Periods** — Two per day, each lasting about 1 hour. These are secondary windows. Not as intense as the majors, but they still produce noticeable upticks in feeding activity. Think of them as the undercard before the main event — worth showing up for, especially when other conditions are favorable.

That gives you four predicted feeding windows every single day. Six hours of elevated activity out of 24. Not bad if you can plan around them.

## What Triggers Major Feeding Periods?

Major periods are tied to the moon's transit — fancy talk for when the moon is at its highest point in the sky above you, or directly on the opposite side of the Earth beneath your feet. These two positions create the strongest gravitational influence on the water (and apparently on the fish in it) at your location.

### Moon Overhead (Transit)

The first major period centers around **moon transit** — the moment the moon reaches its highest altitude in the sky at your location. The feeding window opens about an hour before transit and closes about an hour after. This is the big one. If you can only fish one window in a day, this is the one to target.

You can't just look up and eyeball this, by the way. Moon transit doesn't correspond to any obvious visual cue unless you're tracking the moon's path across the sky with instruments. It changes every day and varies by location. You need a solunar calendar or tool to know when it's happening.

### Moon Underfoot

The second major period happens roughly 12 hours after moon transit, when the moon is on the opposite side of the Earth — directly "underfoot." Same gravitational principle, just from the other side. The feeding window is again about 2 hours, centered on that underfoot position.

This one throws people off because the moon might not even be visible in the sky during the underfoot period. Doesn't matter. The gravitational pull is still there, and the fish don't seem to care whether you can see the moon or not.

> **Why Two Major Periods?** It's the same reason we get two high tides a day. The moon's gravity creates a pull on both the near side and far side of Earth. Your fishing spot feels both, roughly 12 hours apart. If you want the full breakdown on how this works, check out [How the Moon Affects Tides & Fishing](/learn/how-does-moon-affect-tides).

## What Triggers Minor Feeding Periods?

Minor periods are tied to **moonrise** and **moonset** — the moments the moon crosses your local horizon, either coming up or going down. The feeding window is shorter, about 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after each event.

### Moonrise

When the moon comes above the horizon, it kicks off a minor feeding window. This transition seems to trigger a bump in fish activity, though typically not as dramatic as the major periods. Still, a moonrise that happens during the last hour of an outgoing tide or right at dawn can produce some surprisingly good fishing.

### Moonset

Same idea, opposite direction. When the moon drops below the horizon, you get another minor period. Moonset during the afternoon or evening can coincide nicely with the natural end-of-day feeding push that a lot of species already exhibit.

> **Don't Sleep on the Minors:** Minor periods get dismissed because they're shorter and less intense. But when a minor period overlaps with sunrise, sunset, or a tide change, the combined effect can rival a major period. Some of my best days have come during a minor period that happened to line up with an outgoing tide at sunset. The fish didn't know it was supposed to be a "minor" window.

## How Moon Phase Affects Feeding Period Strength

Not all major and minor periods are created equal. The moon phase has a big impact on how strong these feeding windows will be.

### New Moon and Full Moon = Strongest Periods

During new and full moons, the gravitational influence is at its peak. [Spring tides](/learn/how-does-moon-affect-tides) are running, water is moving more than usual, and the major/minor feeding windows tend to be at their most productive. If you're going to build your fishing schedule around solunar data, these are the days to prioritize.

Full moon periods have an added bonus — the overnight major period can produce excellent night fishing. Fish that are normally spooky on the flats during daylight will feed aggressively under a full moon, especially during a major period. If you've never fished a full moon major period after midnight, you're missing out.

### Quarter Moons = Moderate Periods

First and last quarter moons produce moderate feeding windows. The periods still exist, and fish still respond to them, but the intensity is dialed back. These are the days where major periods might produce steady action rather than a full-blown blitz.

### Crescent Phases = Weakest Periods

Waxing and waning crescents generally produce the weakest solunar periods. That doesn't mean the fishing will be bad — plenty of other factors drive fish behavior — but the moon-driven feeding boost is at its lowest. On these days, lean harder on tides, [barometric pressure](/learn/how-barometric-pressure-affects-fishing), and time of day to find your windows.

## The Magic Overlaps: When Everything Lines Up

The real power of solunar data isn't using it in isolation. It's looking for days when a major or minor period overlaps with other feeding triggers. When two or three things line up, that's when the fishing goes from "pretty good" to "where has this been my whole life."

### Feeding Period + Moving Tide

A major period during a strong incoming or outgoing tide is the classic combination. The moon's position is triggering feeding behavior, and the current is delivering food right to the fish. This is the overlap that produces those insane bites where you're catching fish on every cast and wondering if this is even legal.

### Feeding Period + Sunrise or Sunset

Dawn and dusk are already peak feeding times for most species. When a major or minor period overlaps with sunrise or sunset — within about 30 minutes of either — the feeding intensity gets amplified. These overlaps don't happen every day, but when they do, set your alarm.

### Feeding Period + Falling Barometer

A major period that happens to coincide with falling barometric pressure before a front? That's a triple threat. The fish are getting the solunar feeding trigger, the pressure change is making them want to eat, and if there's a tide change in there too, you might as well call your boss and tell them you'll be late.

## How to Actually Use This Information

Here's the practical side, because theory is great but catching fish is better:

1. **Check your solunar forecast the night before.** Look at when the major and minor periods fall for your planned fishing day. If a major period lines up with your available time and a tide change, that's your window. Build your trip around it.

2. **Be on the water early.** The feeding window opens an hour before the peak. If the major period is listed as 7:00 to 9:00 AM, you want your lines in the water by 7:00, not pulling into the parking lot at 7:15. These windows are finite — don't waste them rigging up.

3. **Don't abandon ship during off-periods.** The feeding windows predict *peak* activity, not the only activity. Fish still eat between periods. If you're already on the water and catching fish during a non-solunar window, keep fishing. The chart is a guide, not a set of rules.

4. **Track your results.** Keep a simple log — date, time of catch, solunar period, tide, and conditions. After a few months, you'll start seeing your own patterns. Maybe your spot fishes better during the underfoot major than the overhead. Maybe minor periods with an outgoing tide outperform everything else at your creek. Your data is worth more than any general theory.

5. **Don't let it keep you off the water.** The worst solunar day still beats the best day sitting at home reading about solunar theory. If today is the day you can go fishing, go fishing. Solunar data helps you make the most of the time you have — it's not a reason to stay home.

## The Activity Score: A Quick Shortcut

If tracking moon transit times and cross-referencing tide charts sounds like a lot of work, a fishing activity score can simplify things. [My Marine Forecast](https://mymarineforecast.com) calculates a 0-100 activity score for any day and location based on moon phase, feeding period timing, and whether those periods overlap with daylight hours and sunrise/sunset windows.

High score? The solunar factors are stacked in your favor. Low score? The feeding windows might still produce, but other factors like tides and weather will matter more. It's a quick way to compare days when you're deciding which morning to set the alarm.

## Key Takeaways

- **Major periods** (2 hours each) happen at moon transit and moon underfoot — these are your prime feeding windows.
- **Minor periods** (1 hour each) happen at moonrise and moonset — shorter but still productive, especially with overlapping conditions.
- **Moon phase matters.** New and full moons produce the strongest feeding periods. Crescents produce the weakest.
- **Overlaps are everything.** A feeding period that coincides with a tide change, sunrise/sunset, or falling pressure is worth rearranging your schedule for.
- **Four windows per day.** Six total hours of elevated feeding activity. Plan to be fishing during at least one of them.
- **It's a tool, not a guarantee.** Solunar theory improves your odds. It doesn't replace local knowledge, tide awareness, or the ability to read the water in front of you. But it's one more edge — and in fishing, you take every edge you can get.
